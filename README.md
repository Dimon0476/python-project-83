#### A page analyzer is an application that analyzes certain pages for their SEO suitability.  
The Page Analyzer is a full â€” fledged application based on the Flask platform, using PostgreSQL. The principle of building the MVC architecture is taken: working with routing, query handlers and templating, interacting with the database. Deployment takes place on render.com .  

### Opportunities

   * Page added successfully.
